# Add parenthesis

### what it can do
this is a little tool to adjust code format that a single statement after "if" or "for" without parenthesis.
Add parenthesis after it to pass code test

leave the executive file under a directory and run it
it will change the .cpp file code format recursively

### what to do in the future
there is still a lot to do with comment in the source file
